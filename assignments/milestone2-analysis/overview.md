# Milestone 2: Semantic Analysis

In this milestone, the MiniJava editor from the previous milestone is extended with semantic analyses. The extended editor should be able

* to resolve references in a MiniJava program, 
* to calculate types of MiniJava expressions,
* to report semantic errors, warnings, and notes, and
* to provide semantic code completion.
