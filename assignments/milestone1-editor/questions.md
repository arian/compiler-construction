#####Q: How can I disable the cygwin warnings about paths when building on Windows?
A: Add a system [environment variable](http://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them) called "CYGWIN" with the value "nodosfilewarning" (without quotes). Restart eclipse.
