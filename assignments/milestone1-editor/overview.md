# Milestone 1: Syntax Analysis

In the first milestone, an initial Spoofax project is extended to a basic MiniJava editor, that is able 

* to report syntax errors, 
* to assist the creation of MiniJava programs with code templates,
* to show the abstract syntax of a MiniJava program, 
* to provide an outline view of a MiniJava program,
* to support code folding, and
* to pretty-print a MiniJava program.
